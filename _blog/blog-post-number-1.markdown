Helloooooo internet !! This is my first blog post to my new website. I will be using the blog to document project progress or to write about music! 
Let's start off with what I'm doing RIGHT NOW. I am currently making this site using Siteleaf and Jekyll - it is the third Jekyll online website editor I've tried today, and it is the best so far because it only took me a minute to figure out how to write the first page's content and publish it. Major win!!! We are going for speed over fancy features or quality until the whole thing is populated with projects, especially my brain music research. I am presenting a workshop at the MOXsonic conference this weekend and need a place to keep all the files and documentation for my externals. I also plan on implementing an email list so that interested future brain musicians can stay up to date with upcoming developments in the library and performances coming up. Thanks for reading!

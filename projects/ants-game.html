        <b>Ants Game</b>

    This game was inspired by the ant infestation I was facing in my bathroom at the time. I found that ants like to follow the same path that their friends take, generally in a straight line. When I blew on them while they were in the path, they turned around and kept going on the path but backwards. This is a simple danger-avoidant behavior but I thought it would be interesting to make it into a game! This was a project for my Music and Multimedia class, and I had just learned Adobe Animate. 
    Since Flash is no more, Animate offers a HTML5 game framework you can code in called ActionScript. 
    ActionScript was really hard to work with so I am really proud of this game, simple as it seems. I did all the artwork, sound design, animation, and code.

    The goal of the game is to get the ant(s) to the target, without having it run off the screen. You can control the ant's motion by "blowing" on it at the junctions in the bathroom tile, and it will switch directions from its original path.

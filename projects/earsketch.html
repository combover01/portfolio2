        I worked for EarSketch for a year and implemented its current landing page: <a href="https://earsketch.gatech.edu/landing/#/">https://earsketch.gatech.edu/landing/#/</a>

        <br>
        I also implemented the "Learn", "About Us", "FAQ", and "Contact" pages. I did it without CSS libraries because the repo was so complicated before, I wanted it to just work without using any libraries so it would be easy to upkeep and update in the future. The main library being used was Vue for the different page views.
        The site design was done by designers at Amazon.

        This is less of a one-and-done project and more of an ongoing passion project. 
        Essentially, Pure Data was the first programming language I learned, I like making real-time audio systems for live performance, and I love open source software. 
        When I got to Georgia Tech and got involved in the music scene, I found out that a lot of guitarists, and most of my guitar friends, had a pedalboard for their performance rig. As a former band kid, I was really interested in adding effects to my saxophone playing, but I didn't want to learn new hardware or have to buy anything. Hence, Pure Data Pedalboard.
        I created a delay effect first and performed with it in the Spring 2020 "New Artists Showcase" - interestingly one of the last events in the Under the Couch space as we knew it. I then created a bitcrusher effect the next year for a class project. Throughout the years, I have made a pitch shifter, ring modulator, tremolo, and overdrive.
        The delay and the bitcrusher are my best-documented pedals. One day I will get around to making a nicer Git repo for all of them. 
        I also have plans to make them into physical boxes with microcontrollers inside of them that communicate via UDP/local network to the computer to send parameter values for each pedal and also ordering in the effects chain with NFC chips in the side of the boxes. Then I will finally have pedals of my own... and they will be "wireless" since they are just controllers. 

        <br>
        The delay pedal inspired me to create my solo act "lash", I chose the name some time after the first performances. Eventually, I switched to Ableton effects for the saxophone processing for lash, but I would like to switch back to Pd when I have some more time for fun patching.

        <b>Ondes Martenot Projects</b>
        
        <br>1.) Waveshaper Eurorack Module
        <br> This Eurorack module was my senior capstone project at Georgia Tech. 
        I was advised by Dr. Aaron Lanterman, an electrical engineering professor at Georgia Tech who manages the <a href="https://www.vip.gatech.edu/teams/vw9">Retrofuturistic Hardware Lab</a>.
        The project was inspired by Dorien Shampaert's thesis: "The Ondes Martenot Network in the Twenty-First Century:
        The Co-Construction of the Ondes Martenot and its Users" in which he was able to uncover some circuits that the original instruments used. We decided to recreate the filter circuits to create a Eurorack-style module for a modular synth.
        I tested the circuits given in the project diagrams and designed a PCB. Dr. Lanterman fixed my bad PCB design and we got it printed with JLCPCB, and I designed and laser cut the front plate.
        I totally took a video of it working but I cannot find the video so you are going to have to take my word for it for now...
        Here is a picture of it installed in a case for a demo! The picture of me with it has been used in many Georgia Tech promotional materials... I think I look a little insane, giving mad science music technologist.<br>

        <br>2.) 2 resistance-controlled oscillator circuits - phase shift oscillator and oscillating band pass filter
        <br> This was my final project for the "Guitar Amps and Effects" course, ECE4803, taught by Aaron Lanterman. I worked on it before I started the module project, but it is from the same instrument and also not a huge project so I included it here. My task was to build and test the circuits. Eventually I might develop these into their own modules, as they seem like really nice oscillator (I can't call them VCO, can I say RCO?) circuits.

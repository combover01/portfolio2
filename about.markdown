Mir Jeffres is a saxophonist, experimental electronic musician, and a master’s student in the Center for Music Technology at Georgia Tech. A leader in the Atlanta music community, Mir teaches live sound in various student groups and is involved in several local bands including Two Factor Authentication and Lash. This is Mir’s fifth and final year in the GT Music Technology program after being involved with research in interactive performance systems as part of the Brain Music Lab, Robotic Musicianship Lab, and now the IMPACT Lab with Dr. Alexandria Smith. Mir’s current research focus is on new interfaces for live music performance, specifically making it easier to use biosignals like EEG to support acoustic/electronic performance. He is developing a Max external library for biosignal processing to improve accessibility of brain music for computer musicians of all skill levels. This library is used for Mir's own brain music performance practice centered around biofeedback and meditation to augment solo saxophone improvisation.
